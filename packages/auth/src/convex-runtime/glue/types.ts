/**
 * Adapter-based glue types.
 *
 * The package owns auth SEMANTICS (identity resolution, viewer assembly,
 * permission decisions, idempotent bootstrap, self-heal). The CONSUMER owns
 * local storage (their `users` table, their `organizations` anchor) and
 * supplies thin adapter callbacks. This matches the precedent set by
 * `createConvexApiAuthLookupAdapter` and `buildBetterAuthSessionLookup` —
 * package never reaches into consumer tables by name.
 *
 * Two modes, type-discriminated:
 *  - `orgs: "enabled"` — B2B (plasma, CRM, Seal, Aqua, Veil). Full org
 *    surface; anchor adapters required; viewer exposes `requireOrganization`.
 *  - `orgs: "disabled"` — consumer apps. No org context; viewer has no
 *    org methods. Anchor adapters not required.

   * @deprecated Per-member permission overrides are a legacy escape hatch.

   *   1. Stores authorization state OUTSIDE the component's source of truth
   *   2. Forces consumers to maintain a mirror table indexed by
   *      convexAuthMemberId — exactly the pattern the consumer-contract
   *      checker flags as `local-bridge-mirror` (see
   *      docs/migration/truth-migration-playbook.md M3 "per-member
   *      metadata triage").
   *   3. Was already removed from CRM (PR #23 dropped `crm_member_settings`
   *      entirely — feature had 0 rows in prod, was never actually used).
   *
   * Codex audit (2026-05-28): this adapter slot keeps the anti-pattern
   * alive as a first-class seam. Prefer one of:
   *   - Express the variance as a NEW role and assign it (component-truth)
   *   - Move the override into the component (add as a member field)
   *   - Delete the feature (the CRM precedent)
   *
   * The adapter remains in the API for transitional migrations only. It
   * will be removed in a future major (planned for v0.2.0). New consumers
   * MUST NOT implement this adapter — leave it undefined.
   *
   * If you find yourself wanting overrides today, ask: what role would
   * capture this variance? That role is the right answer.
   *
   * `add` and `remove` operate against the role-derived `basePermissions`.
   * Raw replacement arrays were intentionally rejected — that shape is
   * underspecified and was how earlier integrations diverged.
