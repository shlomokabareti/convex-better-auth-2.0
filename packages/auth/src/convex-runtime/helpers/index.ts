 * the value is serialized on the way in and the callee provably cannot reach the

 * Deep-copy `value` into a genuinely mutable structure.
 *
 * Use this at a Convex write boundary -- passing a `readonly` domain model to a
 * mutation that accepts a full record -- instead of asserting the array's
 * mutability at the call site.
 *
 * The copy is real, not a cast dressed up as one. `structuredClone` returns a
 * fresh structure that nothing else holds a reference to, which is what makes the
 * return type honest: the caller's `readonly` guarantee is preserved because the
 * callee never receives the caller's object at all.
 *
 * Declared as an overload rather than written with an assertion. `structuredClone`
 * is typed `<T>(value: T) => T`, so it cannot express "same shape, mutable" -- that
 * relationship lives in `Writable<T>`. An overload lets the public signature state
 * it while the implementation stays deliberately loose, so no `as` appears here or
 * at any call site.
 *
 * Only for values Convex can serialize. `structuredClone` throws on functions,
 * symbols and class instances -- the same values a Convex validator would reject,
 * so a value that survives this call is a value a mutation can accept.
