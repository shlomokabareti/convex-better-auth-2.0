/**
 * Compile-time proof that `Writable<T>` strips `readonly` all the way down, and

 *
 * The runtime tests can only observe that the copy is independent. They cannot see
 * the thing this helper exists for: a deeply-`readonly` domain model failing to
 * satisfy a validator-derived argument type. That failure is a type error, so the
 * proof has to be a type test. If `Writable` ever regresses to a shallow strip, the
 * nested assignment below stops compiling — which is the point. Type-only, no runtime.
